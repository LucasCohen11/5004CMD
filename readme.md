# 5004CMD Final Project
## By Lucas Cohen (SID: 15853992)
This repository contains code (both used and unused) that was made for the final coursework assignment for 5004CMD

What this means is that not all of this code is guaranteed to be complete, work, have comments, or be 100% of my own making (sources for code snippets are apropriately credited in the report).

The finalized code for each task and any other relevant snippets will be included in the report, and can be found in the ```/workflows``` folder in this repository

# Important:
### The datasets had to be excluded due to GitHub's limitations. To get the code to work, the appropriate datasets have to be put into the "data" folder, with the following names:
- ```Trips_by_Distance.csv``` for the larger dataset
- ```Trips_Full Data.csv``` for the smaller dataset
